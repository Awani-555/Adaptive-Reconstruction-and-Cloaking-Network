# Adaptive Scene Reconstruction and Cloaking Network (ASRCN)

> A real-time computer vision framework that reconstructs live scenes and enables adaptive human cloaking using OpenCV-based segmentation and background substitution.

## Features
- Dynamic background capture and reconstruction  
- Real-time color-based cloaking detection  
- Modular architecture (`capture`, `detect`, `process`, `main`)  
- Deployable backend structure for integration with full-stack pipelines  
- Potential extensions: visual privacy, AR, live streaming filters  

##  Tech Stack
- Python, OpenCV, NumPy  
- (Future-ready) Flask / FastAPI for backend APIs  
- (Optional) React or Streamlit for live video dashboards  

##  Applications
- Privacy-preserving camera feeds  
- Augmented reality background masking  
- Smart video conferencing and streaming
